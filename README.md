The file run_analysis.R does the following things:



Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

Creates a second, independent tidy data set, called tidy_data.txt with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
